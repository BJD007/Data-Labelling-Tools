# Data-Extraction


radarrawdataextractor.py
This code does the following:
Sets up the SDR with specified center frequency and sample rate.
Captures a specified number of samples from the SDR.
Processes the samples (converts to complex numbers and removes DC offset).
Provides a method to plot the I and Q components of the signal.
To use this code, you'll need to:
Install the required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, and pyrtlsdr.
Adjust the CENTER_FREQ, SAMPLE_RATE, and NUM_SAMPLES parameters to match your radar system's specifications.
Ensure you have the appropriate SDR hardware connected to your system.
Remember that this is a basic example. Depending on your specific radar system, you might need to:
Implement more sophisticated signal processing techniques.
Handle multiple channels if your radar uses an array of antennas.
Implement real-time data streaming for continuous operation.
Add error handling and logging for robustness.
Implement data saving mechanisms (e.g., to HDF5 files for large datasets).
Integrate with your radar's control system to synchronize data capture with radar operation.
Also, note that working with raw radar data often requires specialized knowledge of your specific radar system's characteristics and the principles of radar signal processing. You may need to consult your radar system's documentation or work with a radar engineer to fully interpret and utilize the raw data.
